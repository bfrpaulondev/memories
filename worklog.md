# Wedding Album Rebuild - Work Log

**Project**: Patrícia & Samuel Virtual Wedding Album (2026)
**Date**: 2026-05-16
**Status**: Complete

## Summary

Complete rewrite of the virtual wedding album app from Prisma/SQLite to MongoDB/Cloudinary, with drag-to-flip page turns, inline signatures, and full mobile responsiveness.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend: MongoDB + Cloudinary (Replaced Prisma/SQLite)

- **Removed**: `prisma/` directory, `src/lib/db.ts` (Prisma client), `db/` directory, `public/uploads/` directory
- **Added**: `src/lib/mongodb.ts` - Mongoose connection with graceful fallback when DB is unreachable
- **Added**: `src/lib/cloudinary.ts` - Cloudinary configuration for image uploads
- **Added**: `src/models/Photo.ts` - Mongoose schema with fields: cloudinaryId, cloudinaryUrl, frame, message, isSignature, signatureForPhotoId
- **Updated**: `src/app/api/photos/route.ts` - POST uploads to Cloudinary, saves metadata to MongoDB (with in-memory fallback)
- **Added**: `src/app/api/photos/signature/route.ts` - POST endpoint for inline signatures linked to specific photos
- **Removed**: `server.js` (old custom server), `src/app/api/route.ts` (placeholder)

### 2. Drag-to-Flip Page Turn (NO ARROWS!)

- Removed all arrow/button navigation (ChevronLeft, ChevronRight icons removed)
- Implemented pointer event-based drag-to-flip system:
  - `onPointerDown`: Records drag start position
  - `onPointerMove`: Calculates rotation angle proportional to drag distance (`angle = (deltaX / pageWidth) * 180`)
  - `onPointerUp`: If angle > 90° (past 50%), completes flip with animation; otherwise springs back
  - Works with mouse, touch, and Apple Pencil (pointer events)
- 3D CSS book effects preserved from CodePen style:
  - `perspective: 1200px` on book container
  - `transform-origin: 0% 0%` on flipping pages
  - `transform-style: preserve-3d`
  - Front face: `rotateY(0deg) translateZ(1px)` with backface-visibility: hidden
  - Back face: `rotateY(180deg) translateZ(1px)` with backface-visibility: hidden
  - Paper texture gradient: `linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(227,227,227,1) 0%, rgba(247,247,247,0) 18%)`
  - Shadow effects during flip
  - Spine shadow in the middle
- Keyboard navigation still supported (ArrowLeft/ArrowRight)
- Mobile single-page mode with swipe gestures

### 3. Inline Signatures Below Photos

- Each photo page has an `InlineSignatureArea` component below the photo
- Shows "Toque para assinar" (Tap to sign) when no signature exists
- When tapped, expands inline to show a signature canvas:
  - Supports Apple Pencil via pointer events with pressure sensitivity
  - Three color options: Royal (#4A1A6B), Ouro (#C9A96E), Ébano (#2D1B3D)
  - Clear and Save buttons
  - After signing, signature image appears below the photo
- Signature uploaded to Cloudinary (`wedding/signatures` folder)
- Metadata saved to MongoDB with `isSignature: true` and `signatureForPhotoId`

### 4. Photo Upload Flow

- PIN protection (code: 2025) with animated 4-digit input modal
- Upload dialog with:
  - Camera capture button (mobile)
  - File picker button
  - Guest name input
  - Frame selector (3 styles: Classic Gold, Floral Lavender, Modern Minimal)
  - Message textarea
  - Image compression before upload
- Photos upload to Cloudinary, metadata to MongoDB
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (socket.io on port 3001)

### 5. Mobile/Tablet/Desktop Responsiveness

- Mobile (< 768px): Single page view, full width, swipe to flip
- Tablet (768px+): Book spread view, two pages side by side
- Desktop (1024px+): Book spread view, larger sizing
- All controls work on touch devices
- PIN modal is mobile-friendly
- Upload dialog is responsive

### 6. Purple/Gold Wedding Theme

- Preserved all CSS variables for wedding colors
- Purple/lavender/amethyst palette with gold accents
- Premium paper textures, ornamental dividers, gold shimmer animation
- 3 decorative photo frames: Classic Gold, Floral Lavender, Modern Minimal
- P&S monogram on cover
- Dark purple cover and back cover with gold text

```

## Known Issues

1. **MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist**: The MongoDB Atlas cluster is not accessible from this sandbox environment due to IP whitelisting restrictions. The app gracefully falls back to in-memory storage. To fix: add the server's IP to the Atlas whitelist.

2. **First API call is slow**: The first GET /api/photos call takes ~3-4 seconds because it attempts MongoDB connection first (with 3s timeout) before falling back. Subsequent calls use the cached connection status and respond faster.

## Verification

- ✅ `bun run lint` passes with no errors
- ✅ Homepage loads (HTTP 200)
- ✅ API returns `{"photos":[]}` (empty array when no photos)
- ✅ WebSocket service running on port 3001
- ✅ Dev server running on port 3000
- ✅ No Prisma/SQLite code remaining
- ✅ All arrow navigation removed, replaced with drag-to-flip
- ✅ `bun run build` succeeds
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/bfrpaulondev/memories.git (main branch)

Task: Redo flip effect with Framer Motion springs + change PIN to 2026 + add realistic book effects

Work Log:
- Changed PIN from 2025 to 2026 (code default: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WEDDING_PIN || '2026'`)
- Replaced requestAnimationFrame-based flip engine with Framer Motion `animate()` function
  - Complete flip: spring physics with stiffness=130, damping=20, mass=0.9 (natural book feel)
  - Spring back: stiffness=260, damping=28, mass=0.7 (snappy return)
- Removed old `animFrameRef` and `FLIP_COMPLETE_DURATION`/`FLIP_SPRING_DURATION` constants
- Added `flipAnimationRef` for Framer Motion animation cleanup
- Reduced drag threshold from 8 to 5 for more responsive feel
- Added page corner peel hints (animated curl suggesting page can be turned)
  - Right page: bottom-left corner peel (forward direction hint)
  - Left page: bottom-right corner peel (backward direction hint)
  - Subtle breathing animation with gold accent
- Added page stacking effect (visible page edges like a real book)
  - Right side edges for forward pages
  - Left side edges for backward pages
  - Mobile version with bottom-right stack
- Added page bend gradient (simulates page curving near the spine during flip)
- Added cast shadow (page shadow falling on the page beneath during flip)
- Increased CSS perspective from 1500px to 1800px for better 3D depth
- Added `will-change: transform` for GPU-accelerated flipping
- Enhanced shadow intensities for more realistic book appearance
- Updated CSS section title to "Premium Framer Motion Edition"
- Build succeeds, deployed to Vercel via GitHub auto-deploy

Stage Summary:
- PIN is now 2026 (hardcoded default + env var)
- Flip engine uses Framer Motion spring physics for fluid, natural page turning
- Page corner peel hints animate to suggest page turning direction
- Page stacking effect shows visible edges like a real book
- Page bend gradients simulate paper curving near the spine
- Cast shadows add depth during page flip
- Production: https://memories-wedding.vercel.app
- ⚠️ User should update `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEDDING_PIN` env var on Vercel from 2025 to 2026 (or remove it to use the code default)
